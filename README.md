# OPTIMIZATION-MODEL


# üìà Business Optimization Model using Linear Programming (Task 4 ‚Äì CodTech Internship)

This project solves a business problem using **Linear Programming (LP)** techniques and the **PuLP** optimization library in Python. It is part of Task 4 of the CodTech internship, where the goal is to model and optimize a real-world scenario using mathematical optimization methods.

## üéØ Objective

To design and implement a linear programming model that optimizes a specific business objective (e.g., maximize profit or minimize cost) under given constraints. The solution is implemented in Python using the `PuLP` library.

# Profit Maximization using Linear Programming

This project solves a real-world business problem using linear programming and the PuLP library in Python.

## Problem Statement

A factory produces two products, A and B, using two machines. Each machine has limited working hours. The goal is to find the optimal number of units to produce to maximize total profit.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PuLP (Linear Programming Solver)
- Jupyter Notebook


‚öôÔ∏è Problem Description

The project tackles a real-world scenario such as:

üì¶ Product mix optimization

üè≠ Resource allocation in manufacturing

üßæ Cost minimization or profit maximization

üìä Supply chain logistics planning

The problem is mathematically formulated using:

-Decision Variables

-Objective Function

-Constraints

üß™ Solution Approach

The model is solved using the PuLP library, a powerful tool for linear optimization in Python. The process involves:

Defining variables and constraints

Formulating the objective function

Solving the problem using LpSolver

Displaying the optimal solution

Providing business insights


üöÄ How to Run

Clone or download this repository

Install required packages:

pip install pulp
Open and run the optimization_model.ipynb notebook

Follow along to understand the problem setup, constraints, and solution

‚úÖ Project Status

 Business problem selected and formulated

 Linear programming model created using PuLP

 Constraints and objective function defined

 Model solved and validated

 Output analyzed and visualized

 Final notebook and screenshots prepared

üìå Notes

The optimization model can be easily extended to more complex use cases (integer programming, non-linear constraints, etc.)

This project demonstrates practical application of OR (Operations Research) in business using Python.

## Output Summary

- Optimal units of Product A: 20
- Optimal units of Product B: 60
- Maximum Profit: ‚Çπ1800
